# Cryptocurrency can be successful currency

Currency is a social construct. There should be nothing surprising about this.
From a young age, we gain intuition for the worth of the currency used where
we live. We collectively accept that the worth of money is agreed upon. The
most important aspect of a currency is *purchasing power*. Money is worth what
you can buy with it, where you live at that moment. After all, it makes no
difference to a citizen of Canada that their 5 dollars could be traded for one
less U.S. dollar than last year, if they can buy the exact same loaf of bread
for the exact same price, in Canadian dollars. If goods and services are priced
in a currency, then the true worth of that currency is fixed, regardless of
supply and demand in the markets trading between different currencies.

Of course, there are some requirements for something to be a viable currency.
However, none of these requirements appliey only to cryptocurrency, and not
to traditional money. A currency, to be viable for real usage, must be stable
enough that prices in that currency are also stable. As of right now, no
cryptocurrency is viable for real usage. This is because goods are simply
priced in dollars, and all crypto payments are conversions from dollars. This
can change. It must also be widely adopted and accepted for payments, but it is
implied, if your price goods in a currency, that you accept that currency for
payments. Other than adoption, the **only** requirement for a currency that
is viable for the real world is that its worth (purchasing power) stays stable.
Stability on the long term must be achieved through managing supply and demand.
If it is not managed properly, people will just change their prices often, or
switch to other currencies (making the old currency useless). Supply and demand
which is not naturally created by markets should be created by emission of new
money, which is called inflation. This management of the supply of money is not
a problem unique to either traditional currency or cryptocurrency.

This is where Bitcoin in particular fails. By having a fixed supply limit and
lowering inflation over time, Bitcoin *guarantees that it is unusable as a
currency*. All cryptocurrencies have what we call an inflation schedule.
Bitcoin's schedule enforces the fixed supply, but most cryptocurrencies now
have low but positive long-term inflation rates, much like normal currencies in
the real world. This provides a plethora of advantages that real economists can
tell you about, but which are not in the scope of this article. Newer
cryptocurrencies even make inflation more stable and equitable than in
traditional currency. This is explored further in [another article](crypto_inflation.html).

You may have heard that cryptocurrencies are assets that are
speculative in nature, but they are not any more so than traditional currency
is. The expectation that they are volatile is what perpetuates crypto not being
used to price goods, thus making them purely speculative, creating a vicious
cycle. Cryptocurrency can be successful as currency. We just have to break this
cycle.
