# Artificial Scarcity and Abundance Incentives

We want good things. We want more good things to be made. In fact, we want an
abundance of good things. So, we reward those who make good things. This is
extremely intuitive: much of our society is built on incentivizing creation.
Money, for example, and the exchange of goods of equal value makes it necessary
for everyone to contribute to the economy. However, this foundation is flawed.

Counter-intuitively, it is very easy to disguise systems that artificially
*reduce* abundance (called *artificial scarcity*) as systems that incentivize
creation (what I will call *abundance incentives*).

## Money

Money itself is an example of this phenomenon. Money represents value, created
through labor, and so those who have money can pay others for their work.
Conversely, one who provides goods and services gets money in exchange.
If only this is explained, money sounds like an abundance incentive.

But money is issued by authorities, and only then lent to those who do not have
it. The *scarcity* of money — artificially imposed — leads to hoarding,
recession cycles, and many other problems. Incentives *are* created by a money
system with an authority, but the will of those who can issue new money — or
have accumulated large amounts of money through exploiting its scarcity — is
imposed.

There are two kinds of solutions to this problem. The easy answer is to simply
remove the system and hope that it was not necessary, like communism. The other
solution is creating systems which function differently, like mutual credit,
such that everyone is capable of participating in exchange. Both of
these situations would be preferable to the exploitation that is made possible
by artificial scarcity.

In plain terms, money should not be something some people *own* — it should be
something we all use. This small difference is what set apart artificial
scarcity and abundance incentives.

## Intellectual Property

Intellectual property is another obvious system of artificial scarcity. In
effect, it rewards those who innovate with legal monopolies. This is a problem
for many reasons.

The idea that an individual may have resources and the knowledge of useful ways
to assemble them, but should be punished for assembling them, in order to
"protect" another individual (which would not be harmed by this action of
arranging resources), is utterly baffling.

The distribution of information is positive-sum: an individual sharing
information does not lose anything, but one who receives information does gain
something. Necessarily, the enforcement of intellectual property is
negative-sum, it can only prevent people from learning things or using their
knowledge. But there is not only detriment during censorship, enforcement must
be intrusive too.

To enforce intellectual property, authorities must know that information has
been propagated and who has propagated it. The capability of monitoring the
flow of information can and will be used for surveillance. Intellectual
property is deeply incompatible with freedom of speech even when no censorship
is actively performed.

Technically, something *is* protected. Businesses are protected from
competition. This allows companies to charge the highest amount people are
willing to pay for the information, as opposed to the value of the good itself.
This additional profit, given to only the owner of the intellectual property,
is what is protected.

Is there any reason why this profit should be protected? Does the benefit of
the information to the public really outweigh the price difference and the
detriment caused by the enforcement of the monopoly? Would the benefit to the
public of the information not be even greater if the information was available
at a lower price?

These questions are all hard to answer because it is impossible to determine
one objective value for information. Each individual values information
differently, and we can only speculate of alternate universes without these
monopolies. The real question becomes whether the inventor's value of their
own work should be imposed on all who wish to use the information.

Moreover, almost information is derived from other information. By making the
use of information a scarce resource, intellectual property necessarily
restricts the advancement of knowledge. Again, incentives *are* created, but
they do not reward abundance, they reduce it, and reward exploitation.

## Circularity

Artificial scarcity is all or nothing. For any kind of artificial scarcity,
at least another is necessary to perpetuate it.

For both of the examples above, a police force is necessary for enforcement.
The police itself is an example of artificial scarcity. Although it is
reassuring to have a dedicated group which says will protect you, there is
no reason to believe such a group is necessary, or even beneficial.

A police force has power, it is given privileges. The existence of these
privileges incentivizes those who seek privilege to join the police force.
However, there is no incentive for those who legitimately want to help. Human
emotion naturally incentivizes us to protect one another, but doing such is
discouraged, and a system of power is instead given privilege. Without a
police force, those who want to help others could choose to do just that,
without regards for some arbitrary code imposed in order to reduce abundance.

The justice system, itself an example of artificial scarcity, enforces other
scarcities such as the money monopoly and intellectual property. Conversely,
their labor (of reducing abundance) is compensated by the state, issuer of
money, sometimes through taxation, itself enforced by the justice system.
And so artifical scarcity is a vicious circle of self-reinforcing destruction.

If we are to believe that a centralized police force is necessary, then
recessions, wealth inequality, and poverty are equally necessary.

## Technology

Technology is a great way to escape authority. The creation of non-violent
alternatives allows us to create abundance regardless of attempted
restrictions. However, there is not one single solution to our problems. 

Sadly, cryptocurrency does not solve artificial scarcity in any way. Instead
of a central bank, a piece of code takes control of issuance, but issuance *is*
still centralized. Cryptocurrency in its current form, like fiat currency,
still creates hierarchies. However, this is not an inherent problem of
blockchains, and it is very much possible to create mutual credit using
permissionless databases like blockchains.

Failures like Bitcoin should not discourage us from further experimentation.
Every time we create a new system and it fails to solve the problem, we learn
and get closer to a world without artificial scarcity. These failed experiments
are sometimes comparatively better than the currently imposed systems, and may
still be preferable.
